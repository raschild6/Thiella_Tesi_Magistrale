\section{PDDL Problem and Domain}\label{sec:PDDL} 

\begin{footnotesize}
\textbf{Code in PDDL notation:} Description of the problem as a definition of the domain, objects, initial state (INIT) and goal. \\
In this example: four blocks (A, B, C, D) are arranged independently on the table and the robot's hand is free. The goal is a stack formed by the four blocks placed in reverse alphabetical order (D on C on B on A).
\end{footnotesize}

\begin{python}
(define (problem BLOCKS-4-0)
	(:domain BLOCKS)
	(:objects D B A C - block)
	(:INIT (CLEAR C) (CLEAR A) (CLEAR B) (CLEAR D) 
		(ONTABLE C) (ONTABLE A) (ONTABLE B) 
		(ONTABLE D) (HANDEMPTY))
	(:goal (AND (ON D C) (ON C B) (ON B A)))
)
\end{python}

\begin{footnotesize}
\textbf{Code in PDDL notation:} Description of the domain, concerning the problem above, as all possible actions and \enquote{predicates} available. \\
Predicates are the \enquote{states} in which one or more objects can be. Actions, takeable by the robot, are described as input parameters, preconditions for performing that action and effects once the action is completed. 
\end{footnotesize}

\begin{python}
(define (domain BLOCKS)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types block)
  (:predicates (on ?x - block ?y - block)
	       (ontable ?x - block)
	       (clear ?x - block)
	       (handempty)
	       (holding ?x - block)
	       )

  (:action pick-up
	     :parameters (?x - block)
	     :precondition (and (clear ?x) (ontable ?x) 
  			     (handempty))
	     :effect
	     (and (not (ontable ?x))
		   (not (clear ?x))
		   (not (handempty))
		   (holding ?x)))

  (:action put-down
	     :parameters (?x - block)
	     :precondition (holding ?x)
	     :effect
	     (and (not (holding ?x))
		   (clear ?x)
		   (handempty)
		   (ontable ?x)))
  (:action stack
	     :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
	     :precondition (and (holding ?x) (clear ?y))
	     :effect

		   (not (clear ?y))

	     (and (holding ?x)
		   (clear ?y)
		   (not (clear ?x))
		   (not (handempty))
		   (not (on ?x ?y)))))
